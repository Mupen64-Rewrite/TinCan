# TASInput2

The successor to the original TASInput. Powered by wxWidgets to appear native on all target platforms.

Currently WIP and not working yet. I'm trying to work out the issue of conflicting event loops.

## Building

This project uses vcpkg on all platforms. The presets require `VCPKG_ROOT` to be set, however manual building will work just fine.
